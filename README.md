<h2>Installation</h2>
<h4>Step 1 - Installing Python</h4>
Go and head over to <a href="https://www.python.org">here</a> and download Python 3.5 <strong>Before installing make sure "ADD TO PATH" is checked!</strong>


<h4>Step 2 - Installing Discord.Py and Pip Modules</h4>
First run this command in cmd for updating of Pip

Alright, now that we've installed pip's updates, now we have to install Discord.py! Run this command in cmd

Nice work that was probably really difficult. Go to the area you want to install the bot to. Don't make a new folder, git will make one for you! Right click inside the folder and click on the highlighted option

Now paste this into the git bash

> git clone https://github.com/Discord-ian/selfbot.git discordselfbot

After it downloads, go to the folder. Shift right click and click on this option.

Now, head back to that command window and type:

> python bot.py

<strong>To find the bot commands type</strong>
